Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and statistical models to make decisions or predictions about data. With today's computing power, machine learning is changing the world faster than ever before. With unsupervised learning, algorithms use test data to build models that categorize the relationships among data points. For example, when you review an item for purchase on a website, unsupervised learning algorithms might identify related items that people frequently purchase together. create a machine learning model that groups cryptocurrencies. The purpose will be to assemble investment portfolios that are based on the profitability of those cryptocurrencies. Often with unsupervised learning, the goal is to let the machine learning help us figure out what groups, patterns, and structures to use for our data. The machine learning can do all that on its ownâ€”without us telling it what those groups, patterns, and structures are. Instead, it learns from the data that we give it and figures them out by itself with the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm K-means to help cluster our data into groups.
